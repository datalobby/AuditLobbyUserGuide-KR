# \(Venu/Done\)"What should I do when my verification code expires?"

When an administrator registers for a new account, two sign-up related emails \(1. Temporary Password, 2. Verification Code\) will be sent to the new user. The verification code for initial account verification expires in 24 hours after the email is received.

* **If the verification code has expired,** 
  * Reissue a verification code. Please refer to the following article. [**Reissue a new verification code**](../undefined-2/setup/0./1-2.-2.md)\*\*\*\*

If you have any difficulties or have any questions during the process, please feel free to contact us at support@datalobby.co.kr.
