## 1. Summary about how to suspend/remove the user.

1. Click the 'Set Up' button from the left menu column of the Organization View
2. Click the 'User' tab from the setup menu screen
3. Search for the name of the user who wants to remove or delete
4. Click the menu button \(three point button\) at the right end of the user information and click Suspend
5. A message appears on the upper right of the screen saying that the user has been blocked and the user is greyed out

   > Users will no longer be able to log in to auditlobby and will be deactivated in all their projects. The user's sign-off and activity are preserved in auditlobby. If you recover a user, you can reactivate as the same user. However, even if the user is restored, the individual project is deactivated. Therefore, the user must be activated separately in the project to which access is granted.

6. If you need to delete a user, click the right-click menu button of the blocked user and click Remove

   > Deleted users disappear from the user list, sign-offs and activity history are preserved in the lobby. You will not be able to regenerate the same account when you delete it, and you will not be able to continue working on your old record. Be careful when deleting users.
