# \(ENG/Venu to Upate\)"The file is not saved when modifying the contents using Online-Editor"

#### Issue Observation

> If you open and edit a file online and click "Save" button, you get the message saying **"Do you want to leave the site? Changes may not be saved."**  After this warning message appears and you press Exit, the screen is converted to 'List of subsidiaries' without saving the changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why does this happen?**

It occurs when a different user tries to modify a file that was modified and saved by another user in advance. This is a bug to be updated in the next release.
