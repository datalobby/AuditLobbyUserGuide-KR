# \(Venu/Done\)"The file is not saved when modifying the contents using Online-Editor"

#### Issue Observation

> Sometimes, when you open a file online, edit and click the "Save" button, you get the warning message saying "Do you want to leave the site? Changes you made may not be saved." Clicking the 'Leave' button closes the online file without saving the changes.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why does this happen?**

It occurs when a user tries to modify a file that was modified and saved by another user in advance. This is a bug to be updated in the next release.
{% endhint %}

## How to Resolve the issue

{% hint style="success" %}

2. Please use the "[Replace](file-replace.md)" function to replace the existing document of the cloud with the updated document on the desktop.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
In addition, please check the list of opened files when editing online documents to avoid duplicate access.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please make sure to check the 'Opened By Others' tab also.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
* There may be team members who don't have "Close" or "Close All" permissions. \('Project User' users\) 
* If you force close the file, other users' unsaved modifications may be lost. 
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
In the online editor, if you close the browser tab by pressing the browser's 'X' button, the file is not considered closed. Please close it by clicking the 'Close' button on the top right of the screen.
{% endhint %}

1. If you check the list of open files and avoid duplicate operations, you may encounter unexpected errors. If you are doing important and urgent work, we recommend you to use **the first method \(1. Replace the existing document in the cloud with the document on your local storage\).**
