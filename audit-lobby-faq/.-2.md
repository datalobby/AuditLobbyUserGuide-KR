# \(Venu/Pending\*\)"I want to attach multiple files to one audit workpaper."

There are three main ways to upload files to the Donation Lobby.

1. How to upload files on your personal computer as 'audit notes' files \(multiple file uploads available\) [ Link](../undefined-2/guide-by-scenario/4./2-2/4-4..md) 
2. How to upload a file from your personal computer as an attachment to an audit record \(multiple file uploads available\) [Link](../undefined-2/guide-by-scenario/4./2-2/2-2-3..md)  
3. How to re-upload the contents of an existing audit record to a file on your personal computer \(multi-file upload is disabled\)

In case 1, the uploaded file is created as an individual audit record. If you want to upload multiple files in one audit record, please refer to the following page.

[Attach a file to the audit workpaper  using the 'file upload' method. ](../undefined-2/guide-by-scenario/4./2-2/2-2-3..md)

If you use the above method, you can attach multiple files to one audit record.
