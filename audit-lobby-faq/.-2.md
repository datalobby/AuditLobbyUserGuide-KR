# \(Venu/Done\)"I want to attach multiple files to one audit workpaper."

There are three main ways to upload files to the Audit Lobby.

1. Add files using 'Multiple Files' facility[ Link](../undefined-2/guide-by-scenario/4./2-2/4-4..md) 
2. Add file using 'Drag & Drop' facility. [Link](../undefined-2/guide-by-scenario/4./2-2/2-2-3..md)  
3. Replace the existing file with the revised file. [Link](../undefined-2/guide-by-scenario/4./2-2/2-2-5.-replace.md)
4. Add multiple attachments to a single audit file. [Link](../undefined-2/guide-by-scenario/4./2-2/2-2-3..md)

In the case\#4, the 'Uploaded File' is created as an individual audit record on 'Workpaper File/ Permanent File' screen. Double-click the file to view the detail page and you can add multiple attachments there, please refer to the following page.
