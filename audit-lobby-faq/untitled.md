description: How to resolve the situation where the screen does not appear.

# \(ENG\)"The screen does not appear."

There are two major situations where the Lobby screen does not appear. 

1. If you are using an Internet Explorer browser and not a Chrome browser
2. If the cache update requires a system update

## 1.  You are accessing Audit Lobby using a web browser other than Chrome, such as Internet Explorer

It is optimized for the 'Chrome' web browser provided by Google. Please access the Donation Lobby via the Chrome browser.

[Guidance of Install Google Chrome](../undefined-2/setup/0.-2/)

## 2. The screen does not appear after system update

We are constantly working to reflect user feedback in Audit Lobby. It seems that sometimes the screen does not appear depending on your computer environment since the update was applied.

In this case, please take the following measures. 

1. Log out and log back in
2. If you try to sign in again after signing out and the problem persists
   1. **Windows** OS users: Press **control + shift + r** on your keyboard. The Chrome Web site will be **"Strongly Refreshed"** and the update will be reflected normally
   2. **Mac** OS users: Press **Command + Shift + r** on your keyboard. The Chrome Web site will be **"Strongly Refreshed"** and the update will be reflected normally

We are working on ways to apply the update without any action.

## 3. Screen does not appear in other situations
