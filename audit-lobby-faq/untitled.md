# \(Venu/Done\)"The screen does not appear."

There are two major situations where the Lobby screen does not appear. 

1. If you are using a browser other than Chrome.
2. If the cache update requires a system update

## 1.  You are accessing Audit Lobby using a web browser other than Chrome, such as Internet Explorer.

Audit Lobby is optimized for the 'Chrome' web browser provided by Google. Please access it using the Chrome browser only.

[Guidance of Install Google Chrome](../undefined-2/setup/0.-2/)

## 2. The screen does not appear after system update

When new features of Audit Lobby will be released, it seems that sometimes the screen might not appear, if the new updates are not reflected in your browser.

In this case, please take the following measures. 

1. Log out from the application.
2. Please do the following based on your computer OS.
   1. **Windows** OS users: Press **control + shift + r** on your keyboard. The Chrome Web site will be **"Hardly Refreshed"** and the updates will be reflected automatically.
   2. **Mac** OS users: Press **Command + Shift + r** on your keyboard. The Chrome Web site will be **"Hardly Refreshed"** and the updates will be reflected automatically.

We are working on the ways to apply updates without any action.

## 3. Screen does not appear in other situations
