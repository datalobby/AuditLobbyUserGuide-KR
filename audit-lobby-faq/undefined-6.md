  If you want to create a project using roll forward, but the project is not
  visible (for Super Admin)

# \(Venu\)"I can't find the project while trying to Roll Forward"

## Cause of the issue

There are two main reasons why a project does not appear in the Roll Forward drop-down.

> When the user is Inactive in the project.
>
> When the project Roll Forward Permission is set to NO to the user.

Either of the above may be the cause or in some cases, both might be applied. If this happens, both problems need to be identified. The verification process is outlined below.

## 1.When the user is Inactive in the project

![Project View &amp;gt; administration &amp;gt; Users &amp;gt; Three dots button &amp;gt; Activate button](../.gitbook/assets/activate_user_sa_1-2.jpg)

1. Visit the project.
2. Open "Administration &gt; Users" screen.
3. Click the three dots button to the right of the user you want to grant Roll Forward Privilege to.
4. Clicking the Activate button opens the 'Activate User!' pop-up.

Click the 'ACTIVATE USER' button.

After enabling the user, check the Roll Forward permission.

## 2.When the project Roll Forward Permission is set to NO to the user

![Project View &amp;gt; administration &amp;gt; Users &amp;gt; Three dots button &amp;gt; Edit button](../.gitbook/assets/edit_roleforward_sa_1.jpg)

1. Visit the project.
2. Open "Administration &gt; Users" screen.
3. Click the three dots button to the right of the user you want to grant Roll Forward Privilege to.
4. Clicking the 'Edit' button opens the 'Edit User' pop-up.

Set the 'Roll Forward Permission' to 'Yes'.

![The success notification appears on the top right of the screen.](../.gitbook/assets/edit_roleforward_sa_3.jpg)

After reviewing both methods, check if the project to be rolled over is active in the Roll Forward drop-down.
