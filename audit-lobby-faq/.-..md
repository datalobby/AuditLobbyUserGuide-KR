# \(Venu/Done\)I received "Email is invalid." message.

In some cases, you get a "The email is incorrect." Or "Email is invalid.” message even though you entered the email correctly.

This is because the login system of Audit LOBBY was configured in such a way that "The email is incorrect" Or "Email is invalid” will be displayed even if the password entered was incorrect. This is just to prevent others from guessing passwords by seeing the message. But, we received the feedback to update this message, as the current configuration confuses users. This will be fixed in the next update.

If you receive an "Email is invalid" message after entering the correct email, please also check your password.

The password of Audit LOBBY must be at least 8 characters including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. If you want to change your password, please refer to the following guide.
