description: When you received "Email is invalid".

# \(ENG\)I received "Email is invalid." message.

In some cases, you get a "The email is incorrect." Or "Email is invalid.‚Äù message even though you entered the email correctly.

This is because the login system of AuditLOBBY is **configured to notify you that an email was entered incorrectly even if the password was entered incorrectly.** This is to prevent other users from guessing passwords by using a notification that the password was incorrect, but there are comments that this device confuses users and will be fixed in the next update.

If you receive an "Email is invalid" message after entering the correct email, please also check your password.

The password of AuditLOBBY must be at least 8 characters including all lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. If you want to change your password, please refer to the following guide.
