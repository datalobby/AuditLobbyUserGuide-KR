# \(Venu/Done\)"Favorites does not work."

## The Most Simple Solution

1. Do not bookmark your login screen or your organization's list \(Organization List\) as a favorite. \(Favorites will not work properly if your favorite address is set to us.auditlobby.com/auditlobby/\#/login\)
2. If your organization doesn't have a dedicated instance, then bookmark the base URLs directly based on your location.
   1. For US users, us.auditlobby.com
   2. For Indian users, in.auditlobby.com
   3. For Korean users, kr.auditlobby.com
3. If your organization has a dedicated instance, then bookmark your organization's audit lobby base URL directly.
   1. Ex: {organizationName}.auditlobby.com
