\*Please refer to other guidance documents for the favorite setting in the lobby.

\*This document is a guide to the case where you register your favorite Lobby lobby as a favorite in a web browser.

## The Most Simple Solution

1. Do not register your login screen or your organization's list \(Organization List\) as a favorite, select your corporation, and set the Home screen that appears as a favorite
2. Register your address directly as kr.auditlobby.com \(Favorites will not work properly if your favorite address is set to kr.auditlobby.com/auditlobby/\#/login\)
