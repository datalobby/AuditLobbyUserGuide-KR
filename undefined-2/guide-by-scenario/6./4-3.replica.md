# \(Razia-Done\)4-3. Using Replicas \(Archive copies\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Archiving a project automatically creates an archive copy called 'replica'. This copy of the archive is separate from the archive project and is intended for the convenience of existing audit team members.
{% endhint %}

## 1\) Characteristics of Archive Copies \(replica\)

* You can download or browse the records of an existing project from the archive copy.
* You can roll forward an archive copy to create a new project.
* New users can be added to grant view, download, and roll forward privileges. 
* You cannot modify the records of an archive copy. \(Only reading and downloading are possible.\)
* Modifications made to the archive copy do not affect the archived project \(Ex: Assign new users etc\) 
* \[Razia-Question:Unable to understand\]아카이브 사본이 생성될 때, 기존 프로젝트에서 프로젝트 및 아카이브 관리자였던 사용자, 그리고 프로젝트 관리자 이면서 롤 포워드 권한이 있었던 사용자 만 활성화 되고, 다른 사용자들은 모두 비활성화 처리 됩니다. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Existing audit team members cannot access the already archived projects.
{% endhint %}

## 2\) Find archive copy/Replica

Select the 'Replica' tab at the top of the project list screen to see a complete list of archive copies.

> The list shown may differ depending on your permissions.

## 3\) Modify user's permissions on archive copies

When a project is archived,  all the users in Archived project will be deactivated.The user's state will carry forward as is in Replica projects.

Example: If a team member is in active state in the project before archive, then the user state will be deactivated in archived project and still be active in replica project

## 5\) Allow Roll forward on Replicas

It's the same way as a regular project. On the administration screen, select the user you want to modify, change the rollforward permission to yes, and save.
