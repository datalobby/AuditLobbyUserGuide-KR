* Where are archive zip files used?
  * After the archive, general team members are blocked from accessing the project. Archive archive allows you to view the contents without unarchiving
  * Archives are stored on remote storage, AWS S3, at the same time that you create the archive. All subsequently downloaded files can be checked for completeness and integrity as a duplicate of this file
* **If the file size is large, it may take some time for the email to arrive late**
* **Sometimes a compressed file may not be created for very large projects. However, the archive will proceed normally**
* If the archive is successful, it will switch to the "My Page" screen and a success notification will appear.
* If the archive is successful, all team members are automatically **deactivated** for that project. \(You can no longer open the project to view or modify its contents.\)‌

## 2. Download ZIP file via link in mail  <a id="2-download-zip-file-via-link-in-mail"></a>

After the archive, you will receive a 24-hour archive compressed file download link in the email of your archiving team. Click on the link in the mail to download the archive archive.‌

After 24 hours, the link will be unavailable. If you need a zip file, you'll need to ask the corporate archive manager to grant access.
