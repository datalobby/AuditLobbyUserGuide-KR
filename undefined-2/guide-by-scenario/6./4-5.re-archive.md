Rationale document upload feature is coming soon to provide the supporting document during rearchive
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Sometimes, if the size of the project is large, the compression may fail, but it is not related to the success or failure of the archive. If you see a success message, you can see that the archive succeeded apart from the file compression.
{% endhint %}

## 4. Download ZIP file via link in email

* After archiving, a compressed file of the archived project will be created, and a link will be sent via email to download
* Within 24 hours, click on the link in the mail to download the archive archive
* If the link has expired, please contact the corporate archive manager

## 5. Contents of the zip file of the re-archived project

Upon the completion of re-archiving, a new archived ZIP file will be created that reflects your modifications. This includes the secondary archive record, and the users and sign-off date to the archive record.

## 6. The versioning of the archived project
