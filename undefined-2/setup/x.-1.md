### What is 'Access Right'?

The Audit LOBBY system is divided into two parts: Organization and Project functions. The menu associated with the overall management of a firm is called the Organization Menu or Organization View, and here the Audit LOBBY users are classified into three types. 

> These three types apply to the Audit LOBBY system for the firm but differ from the roles within each project.

1. Super Admin
2. Group Admin
3. User Access
