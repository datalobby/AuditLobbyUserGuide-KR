The 'External User Right' can be set to either **Read Only** or **PBC Upload**.

### 2.1. Read Only option

* If you wish any external user to view all screens, but do not wish to perform any operations, then set the 'External User Right' field to 'Read Only' option.
* Everything will be in a read only mode for these users.
* The user cannot have access to ‘Archive Diagnosis, Archive, Project Lock/ Unlock, Users \(CRUD\), Comments \(CRUD\), Prepare & Review WP file’.

### 2.2. PBC Upload option

* An External User who is set to ‘PBC Upload’ can **view only** the ‘PBC List’ screen after visiting the project.
* These users can “create, edit, delete” the PBC records and upload auditor requested documents on the PBC List screen.

## 3. Set the user Email

1.  ****Since the 'External User' option is selected, the 'Email' field contains only external users.
2. Click 'Email' field, search and select the user that you wish to assign.

   > If the user's email address is not on the list, please check the following.
   >
   > 1. Does the user assigned to the firm?
   > 2. Does the user assigned to the current group?
   >
   > You can verify the above two on the 'Organization View &gt; Set Up' screen.

3. The Name, User Id and the Title would be entered automatically according to the Email taken.

## 4. Set the 'Project Access Expired Date'

* If you wish the external user access the project up to a specific period of time, you can set the expiry date in the 'Project Access Expired Date' field.
* Past dates won’t be allowed in the Project Access Expired Date field \(it accepts only the current or future date\).
* These users cannot access the project when the current date exceeds the 'Project Access Expired Date'.
