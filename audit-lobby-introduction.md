# \(Draft\)Audit LOBBY Introduction

Audit LOBBY is a program designed to help accounting firms conduct external audits efficiently.

In 2018, the auditing system will be reorganized and the supervision will be strengthened. As punishment standards become more specific and accountability becomes clearer, it becomes even more important to ensure that audits are conducted in compliance with regulations.

Traditional auditing programs had low work cohesion and file compatibility, and their coverage was limited to offline. It was also difficult to manage quality and track current progress.

Audit LOBBY is built on strong regulatory standards. It provides everything you need for external auditing online, and AWS's powerful cloud system enables real-time business management and easy collaboration. You can run an audit team to communicate with your customers, create and manage audit reports and supporting materials.
